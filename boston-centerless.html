        <p class="small-text">Boston Centerless manufactures and distributes precision raw materials. As an Engineering Intern, I developed, designed, and documented mechanical components and assemblies for CNC machines. Sensors mounts I designed were highly effective in increasing performance and efficiency on the shop floor. Additionally, I machined parts for use in manufacturing process. I also wrote standard operating procedures for equipment. For the manufactured pieces, I performed material testing and validation through heat treating and tensile testing. </p>

        <h3>Unload Fixture</h3>
        <div class="row">
            <img src="img/design-10.jpg" width="300" height="200" alt="The 3D printed blue component on the left side is adjustable so that the bar can be lined up exactly with where they exit from the grinding machine. They then slide down the ramp onto the sheets which fold out using hinges">
            <img src="img/design-11.jpg" width="300" height="200" alt="The orange components support the ramp and are 3D printed. The frame is made out of aluminum 80-20 bars.">
            <div class="centered">I designed and assembled an unloader fixture that is connected to a grinding machine. The purpose of this is so that bars are guided out of the grinding machine and into a basket. I worked with a floor technician to understand the design constraints, sketched my ideas, and assembled a model on CAD. I then 3D printed my components and assembled them with pieces from McMaster. It is now successfully running on the shop floor.</div>

        <h3>Sensor Mount</h3>
        <div class="row">
            <img src="img/design-12.jpg" width="300" height="200" alt="The left component (in blue) has a support for the sensor as well as heat set inserts.">
            <div class="centered">I designed and assembled a mount for a sensor that counts bars after they are cut. The two pieces shown to the left envelop part of the machine itself. Using a combination of friction and heat-set inserts, the mount stays perfectly still as bars hit it. The success of my sensor mount allows for more precise counting of bars, enabling the machine to operate more efficiently and effectively by having an accurate head-count.</div>
